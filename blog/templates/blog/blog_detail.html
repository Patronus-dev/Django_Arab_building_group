                                            Statistically, you stand a better chance for success
                                            if you have some sort of strategic ask in almost everything that you do --
                                            in-person, on the phone, over email, or
                                            on social media.</p>

                                            <strong>Think about it:</strong> If you make one additional ask per day and
                                            convert at around 10 percent. Then you have three
                                            people each month providing you with benefits that you'd have missed
                                            otherwise It's essential to make sure that your
                                            ask relates to some direct path to what you want, whether it is revenue, a
                                            business relationship or anything else
                                            of prime importance to you.</p>

                                        <p>Music can help you get into a “flow state” -- losing yourself in the task at
                                            hand. Even repetitive tasks or mundane
                                            assignments seem more bearable, or even fun, when your favorite tunes are in
                                            your ears.</p>
